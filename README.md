# Seeloewen Sync
Simple folder synchronizer by Seeloewen

Warning: This software is still in beta development and has many issues and work-in-progress features. Use with caution. Data loss should not occur and im very sorry if it, but you'll take the responsibility.

Seeloewen Sync allows you to synchronize to folders with one simple click.

It's simple, easy to use and free. Since it's open-source, you'll also be able to see exactly what you get and how it's made. You can even contribute to the project!

## Features
- Synchronize two folders or files (You can even choose the sync direction!)
- Save and load schemes (This means you won't have to choose your folders every time you want to repeat a synchronization, simply load the profile!)
- Compare folders or files to see what changed (Preview of folder/file content and size)

## Planned features
- Live synchronization
