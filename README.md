# Seeloewen Sync
Simple folder synchronizer by Seeloewen

Warning: This software is still in alpha development and has many issues and work-in-progress features. Use with caution.

Seeloewen Sync allows you to synchronise to folders with one simple click.

It's simple, easy to use and free. Since it's open-source, you'll also be able to see exactly what you get and how it's made. You can even contribute to the project!

## Features
- Synchronise two folders (You can even choose the sync direction!)
- Save and load schemes (This means you won't have to choose your folders every time you want to repeat a synchronisation, simply load the profile!)

## Planned features
- Synchronize multiple folders with one click.
- Compare folders to see what changed
- Synchronise and compare single files
- Live synchronisation
