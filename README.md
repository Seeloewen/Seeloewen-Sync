# SealSync
Simple folder synchronizer by Seeloewen

Warning: This software is still in alpha development and not ready for use yet.

SealSync allows you to sync files between two folders with one simple click. Why would you use this synchronizer and not one of the others? I don't really know, this one is free and simple to use but it's up to you what you use. I personally started this project because all the other synchronizers were to complicated or didn't work.

## Planned features
- Synchronize multiple folders with one click.
- Compare folders to see what changed
- MAYBE at some point live synchronization
- Save settings and have multiple synchronization schemes loadable from settings
